    "\n",
    "This section contained a brief introduction to the concept of *ensemble estimators*, and in particular the random forest – an ensemble of randomized decision trees.\n",
    "Random forests are a powerful method with several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both training and prediction are very fast, because of the simplicity of the underlying decision trees. In addition, both tasks can be straightforwardly parallelized, because the individual trees are entirely independent entities.\n",
    "- The multiple trees allow for a probabilistic classification: a majority vote among estimators gives an estimate of the probability (accessed in Scikit-Learn with the ``predict_proba()`` method).\n",
    "- The nonparametric model is extremely flexible, and can thus perform well on tasks that are under-fit by other estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary disadvantage of random forests is that the results are not easily interpretable: that is, if you would like to draw conclusions about the *meaning* of the classification model, random forests may not be the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GBT\n",
    "Gradient boosted trees instead of bagging rely on boosting. I.e. instead of randomly fitting models and averaging buidling the next model in a way that it optimally reduces the error of the predecing one turns out to be very powerfuly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact:\n",
    "- https://catboost.ai\n",
    "- https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ especially https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/model.html\n",
    "- https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "are some of the most popular and very well performing classifiers. Most likely due to:\n",
    "- fairly fast to train\n",
    "- simple to use (no tuning gives OK-ish results)\n",
    "- tuning really good ones\n",
    "- can handle categorical data. No numeric conversion mandatory\n",
    "- cane scale out to arbitrarily large amounts of data in distributed implementations\n",
    "- well tested (as so many people like to use them)\n",
